### About the author
My name is Lucia Macakova and I am a student of the [Atlantic Technical University](https://www.atu.ie/) in the program [Higher Diploma in Science and Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics) in year 2024/2025. I am the only contributor to this project as this is my assignment tasks completion for the module Programming for Data Analytics.

##### Assignment 2 - Weather:
Task: With data from weatherreadings.csv, create a plot of the temperature over time (column "dryBulbTemperature_Celsius").

##### Assignment 3 - Domains:
Task: To create a pie chart of peoples email domains from data of people-1000.csv. 

##### Assignment 5 - Risk:
Task: Write a program that simulates 1000 individual battle rounds in Risk game (3 attacker vs 2 defender) and plots the result. One battle round is one shake of the attacker and defender dice. 
A more complicated version simulates a full series of rounds for armies of arbitrary sizes, until one side is wiped out. Provide plot.

Rules of Risk:

- In Risk one army fights another. (using 6 sided dice).
- In each battle round, the attacker can put forward up to three of their troops (3 dice).
- The defender can use up to two of their defending troops (2 dice).

Each side looses troops depending on the following rules:
- The two top dice dice are compared (ie the attackers top dice roll with the defenders top dice roll) 
If the attackers dice is the same or lower they loose one troop otherwise the defender looses a troop (ie if the attackers dice is higher).
- The next two highest dice from each side are then compared (ie the attackers second highest to the defenders second highest).
- If the attackers dice is the same or lower they loose one troop otherwise the defender looses a troop (ie if the attackers dice is higher)

##### Assignment 6 - Knock Aerport Weather
Task: With data from hly4935.csv file create plot of:
- The temperature
- The mean temperature each day
- The mean temperature for each month
- The Windspeed (missing data from this column have to be corrected)
- The rolling windspeed over 24 hours
- The max windspeed for each day
- The monthly mean of the daily max windspeeds
